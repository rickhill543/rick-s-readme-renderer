## Installation

To run the README generator, copy, clone, or fork this repository and then run the bash command "node index.js" in the root of the application to begin. Application requires the fs and inquirerer dependencies. To install the inquirer package, run the following commands... "npm init" followed by "npm install inquirer". This will setup the necesary packages required by the README application.

## Usage 

This application is used to help speed up development workflow by cutting down on time used for a redundant task, the mundane yet neccesary README.md file used to describe all your projects. By prompting the user with the familiar set of questions usually found in a README file, the file can be generated in just a minute or so in a clean and reapeatable format. Simply answer all the questions and voila! A brand new README file will be generated at the root of the application.
